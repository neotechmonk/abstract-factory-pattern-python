he most important design principle behind the factory is Separate Creation From Use. Doing this helps reducing coupling. You can create specific kinds of objects, and then have another part of your program use those objects, without it knowing any of the details. As a result, you can introduce new objects without having to change the code that uses the objects. A related, more generic principle is the Single Responsibility principle from SOLID.
